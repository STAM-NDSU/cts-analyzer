Change history:
 Constants in procedures replaced by static final fields.
 NF eliminated (function evaluation counting is done in base class).
 MAXFUN eliminated (exception is thrown by base class).
 -1e300 replaced by NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
 1e300 replaced by POSITIVE_INFINITY.
 Number of interpolation points set at construction (no automatic default to ""2n+1"" if set to ""-1"").
 Replaced ""checkParameters()"" with ""setup()"" and moved validity checks from ""doOptimize()"" to ""setup()"".
 Replaced ""boundaries[][]"" with two ""double[]"" for the constraints.
 Removed unit test ""testBoundariesNoData"" (""null"" is interpreted as ""no constraints"").
 Replaced ""xl"" and ""xu"" with ""lowerBound"" and ""upperBound"", respectively (Fortran 1-based indexing still used).
 Replaced ""x"" with ""currentBest"".
 Replaced ""rhobeg"" with ""initialTrustRegionRadius"". Using instance field directly instead of passing it as function argument.
 Replaced ""rhoend"" with ""stoppingTrustRegionRadius"". Using instance field directly instead of passing it as function argument.
 Removed all parameters from ""bobyqa"" function (using instance fields directly).
 Removed (from ""bobyqa"" function) a test on the bound difference: It would never fail because of the auto-correction in ""setup"".
 Replaced ""ScopedPtr"" by ""FortranArray"" for all one-dimensional data.
 0-based loop in ""bobyqa"".
 Replaced ""ScopedPtr"" by ""FortranMatrix"" for all matrix data.
 Loop-local counters in all functions.
 Replaced kopt with ""trustRegionCenterInterpolationPointIndex"" instance variable.
 Removed ""ndim"", ""n"" and ""npt"" from the arguments list of all functions.
 Removed ""w"" from the arguments list of ""update"".
 Removed ""w"" from the arguments list of ""altmov"" (replaced with local variables ""work1"" and ""work2"").
 In ""trsbox"" arguments list, replaced ""ScopedPtr"" (""gnew"", ""xbdi"", ""s"", ""hs"", ""hred"") by ""FortranArray"".
 Removed ""ptsaux"", ""ptsid"" from arguments list of ""rescue"" (replaced with local variables).
 Corrected bug in ""rescue"" function.
 Removed ""w"" from arguments list of ""rescue"".
 Removed ""glag"" and ""hcol"" from arguments list of ""altmov"" (replaced by local variables).
 Removed ""w"" from arguments list of ""bobyqb"" (replaced by local variables).
 Removed global work space ""w"".
 Removed auxiliary class ""ScopedPtr"".
 Removed ""alpha"" and ""cauchy"" (""DoubleRef"") in ""altmov"" arguments list: Values returned in a ""double[]"" array.
 Removed ""dsq"" and ""crvmin"" (""DoubleRef"") in ""trsbox"" arguments list: Values returned in a ""double[]"" array.
 Removed ""DoubleRef"" auxiliary class.
 Removed unused local variables; changed some to be ""final"".

The least squares package now has two main interfaces LeastSquaresOptimizer and
LeastSquaresProblem, where the optimizer can be applied to the problem.

In this commit all of the test cases pass with one change (annotated) to
LevenbergMarquardt.testControlParameters(). The tests for Gauss Newton were
expanded to cover using the QR decomposition, which revealed a QR default
tolerance discrepancy.

A factory and a mutable builder were create for LeastSquaresProblem.

Re-factored the code in GaussNewtonOptimizer so that the decomposition
algorithm sees the Jacobian and residuals instead of the normal
equation. This lets the QR algorithm operate directly on the Jacobian
matrix, which is faster and less sensitive to numerical errors. As a
result, one test case that threw a singular matrix exception now passes
with the QR decomposition.

The refactoring also include a speed improvement when computing the
normal matrix for the LU decomposition. Since the normal matrix is
symmetric only half of is computed, which results in a factor of 2 speed
up in computing the normal matrix for problems with many more
measurements than states.

Overhaul of the ""optimization"" package.
Removed lots of duplicate code.
Removed methods referring to the concept of ""iteration"".
Removed interface methods to access the number of evaluations of the
gradient and Jacobian.
Removed all references to ""OptimizationException"" (replaced by
""ConvergenceException"").
Javadoc comments updated.

In org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RealVectorAbstractTest

  - factored out unit tests of void RealVector.unitize(),
  - created unit tests of Iterator<RealVector.Entry> RealVector.iterator().

In org.apache.commons.math3.linear.ArrayRealVector, removed unnecessary overrides of unitVector() and unitize().

In org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RealVector
  - unitVector() and unitize() now throw an ArithmeticException when the norm is 0 (as specified in the Javadoc),
  - the returned iterator() returns NoSuchElementException as specified in the general contract of iterators.
