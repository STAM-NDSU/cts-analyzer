Removed dead code for object graph navigation.

Moved some classes into 'internal' so they are visible to the 'bind' subpackage.

Turned some TypeAdapterFactory/TypeAdapter pairs inside out so that the TypeAdapter is now the inner class. This is necessary so that the factories can take parameters.

Added an API to request the 'next' type adapter for a type. This allows type adapters to compose other type adapters. We're using this in two places:
 - where the user has excluded a type from serialization but not deserialization, we need to use the ""default"" deserialization but interpose null on serialization. We create a type adapter that delegates for one and returns null for the other.
 - similarly when a DOM type serializer is registered but no deserializer, or vice versa.

Revert #1218

Usage of sun.misc.Unsafe to change internal AccessibleObject.override field
to suppress JPMS warnings goes against the intentions of the JPMS and does not
work anymore in newer versions, see #1540.
Therefore remove it and instead create a descriptive exception when making a
member accessible fails. If necessary users can also still use `java` command
line flags to open external modules.

* Fix failing to serialize Collection or Map with inaccessible constructor

Also remove tests which rely on Java implementation details.

* Don't keep reference to access exception of ConstructorConstructor

This also avoids a confusing stack trace, since the previously caught
exception might have had a complete unrelated stack trace.

* Remove Maven toolchain requirement

* Address review feedback
